    <h1>Poem de fortnite
    </h1>
    
<p>
You priceless free application,
<br>
allowed me to vegetate for hours at ease.
<br>
You innovative approach to gaming,
<br>
that will forever own a five star suite in my heart.
<br>
Some hear your name, 
<br>
and chuckle ahaha or take part in mockery.
<br>
good golly do I feel bad, 
<br>
at how they themselves must miss your gameplay.
<br>
From Haunted Hills to Lucky Landings,
<br>
you gifted me a virtual world of possibilities filled with joy.
<br>
Combining creativity with competitiveness,
<br>
a victory royale, Nirvana is what I would see. 
<br>
You lost your unmatched popularity,
<br>
and like unrefrigerated milk, you drew sour.
<br>
It hurts me to even say it,
<br>
but I resented you and cut you out of my life.
<br>
Everything turned to grey
<br>
until I rediscovered my love for you
<br>
You aged not like yogurt but like wine!
and Iâ€™d take criticism from others to keep our spark alive.
<br>
I love how you pushed me to live to my fullest.
I love how you unlock my societal chains.
I love that you will forever be a part of me.
I love you Fortnite.
